                    <p> I interned at Mercedes-Benz Financial Services in 2019 as an IT Intern.
                        During my time there, I mainly worked on an online dashboard from creation and design to creating a final deliverable.
                        A couple interns and I were also able to create and deliver a B2E iOS app, <i>weCare</i>, to simplify internal communication.
                        I was able to familiarize myself with several tools and frameworks and learned several lessons regarding software engineering and corporate structure while growing my professional network.

                        Our group designed and programmed a prototype for a working bike lock that used an RFID tag to lock and unlock.
                        Later, we conducted surveys on students and presented this research and future plans at a research symposium.
